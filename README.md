# Library Inventory
A user interactive library inventory management system with a command line interface, written in Python. The user can view, add and check out or return books in the inventory. This application was written in Visual Studio Code on a Windows 10 computer.

This project was created as part of the March 2024 Girls Who Code and Autodesk Technical Interview Prep (TIP) Bootcamp. There, I practiced technical interviews prompts and honed experience with a take home assignment alongside over 100 Girls Who Code peers. The bootcamp helped me identify areas for continued improvement in both technical and communication skills and receive feedback from employees at Autodesk.

## Technical Interview Prompt
The following prompt was provided for the take home assignment provided in the Girls Who Code and Autodesk TIP Bootcamp:

Imagine you are a librarian and **want to develop an inventory management system that keeps track of which books are in the library and which ones have been checked out.** Write a program with the following functionality:

- The user can print out a list of each book and its status (“on shelf” or “checked out”).
- The user can add new books to the inventory. The default status of newly added books will be “on shelf."
- The user can toggle the status of each book between “on shelf” and “checked out.”

The user should interact with the program using the command line interface. **When you write your program, you should also consider its overall design.** Your solution can be in a language of your choosing. If you have time, think about what other functionality you might add. Try to implement it for an extra challenge!


## How to Use
1. Open and run the program in an IDE of your choice. 

2. The program will output text in the command line. It gives the user 4 options, which can be chosen by entering the corresponding number between 1 and 4. 
![A screenshot of the program running in the command line. It greets the user by saying "Welcome to the Bookworm library! What would you like to do today? Please type the corresponding number for what you would like to do:" and then offers the user 4 options. The first option is to "Print out the current book inventory," the second is to "Add a new book into the inventory," the third to "Check out or return a book to the shelf," and the fourth is to exit.](libraryInventory.jpg)

3. Follow the instructions for each option.
